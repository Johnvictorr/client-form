# client-form
A client registration form, using the next.js/react structure and tailwind css to create a well-structured and responsive template. This repository contains one of the forms from a freelance project I'm working on for a law firm system that will be launched soon. The purpose of this repository is to help me practice my front-end skills using frameworks.
